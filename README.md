# Predicting Kickstarter Project Success

I analyzed 20,000 projects from 2014 to 2018 on the popular crowdfunding platform: Kickstarter. I built classification models using linear regression, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, and xgboost in order to predict whether a project would meet its funding goal by the deadline.
